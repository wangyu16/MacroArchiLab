title: "Jupyter Notebook RDRP Kinetic Simulator by the Method of Moments"
teaser: "This program runs in Jupyter notebook, provides fast kinetic simulation for conventional radical polymerization, different types of ATRP, NMP and RAFT. The output includes concentration changes of all species, the number average molecular weights and molecular weight distribution, and the mole percentage of end group loss."

## Introduction


## To Start

1. Download the file "RDRP_Kinetic_Simulator_Moments.ipynb".
2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) with Python 3.6 or above.
3. Install the package ['chempy'](https://pypi.org/project/chempy/).
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5. Navigate to the folder with the "RDRP_Kinetic_Simulator_Moments.ipynb" file and open it. 
6. Go to the "Reaction conditions" section and input the reaction condition you want to simulate. 
7. Excute the code cells from the top to the end one by one by using "Shift + Enter". 
8. Get the results from the plots and the exported csv file.
