## Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- Pursuing more efficient synthetic methods and achieving higher level perfection in the design of polymer architectures via novel polymerization methods;
- Study of polymeric materials with well-defined structures for highly efficient recognition/detection, adsorption, and selective conduction, etc. Those include
  - Ion exchange membranes for energy conversion and storage devices; 
  - Porous carbon for electrode materials in Na ion batteries;
  - Electrochemical sensors;
  - Detection and removal of PFAS from the environment, etc.
- Developing educational tools for polymer science education.
