## Research Interests

My research focuses on pursuing more efficient synthetic methods and achieving higher level perfection in the design of polymer architectures via novel polymerization methods; and the study of applications of polymeric materials with well-defined structures in energy conversion and storage devices, detection of chemicals at low concentrations and removal of harmful chemicals from the environment, etc.
