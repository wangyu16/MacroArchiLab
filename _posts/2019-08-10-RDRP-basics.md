## Brief History 

Though the term "living" radical polymerization was used in early days, it has been discouraged by IUPAC, because radical polymerization cannot be a truly living process due to unavoidable termination reactions between two radicals. The commonly used term controlled radical polymerization is permitted, but reversible-deactivated radical polymerization or controlled reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) is recommended.

## Examples of RDRP

### Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)


### Nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP)


### Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)


### Catalytic chain transfer and cobalt mediated radical polymerization


### Iniferter polymerization


### Iodine-transfer polymerization (ITP)



### Selenium-centered radical-mediated polymerization


### Telluride-mediated polymerization (TERP)



### Stibine-mediated polymerization
