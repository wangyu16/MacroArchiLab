## Introduction

Though the term "living" radical polymerization was used in early days, it has been discouraged by IUPAC, because radical polymerization cannot be a truly living process due to unavoidable termination reactions between two radicals. The commonly used term controlled radical polymerization is permitted, but reversible-deactivated radical polymerization or controlled reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) is recommended.
